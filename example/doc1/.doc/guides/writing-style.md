# Writing Style Checklist

- Prefer active voice when describing actions.
- Keep paragraphs short so the rendered documentation stays scannable.
- Link to related pages using absolute paths (for example `/guides/automation`).

> This page lives directly inside the `.doc` workspace and illustrates how
> doc-builder preserves curated content alongside prefixed markdown files.
