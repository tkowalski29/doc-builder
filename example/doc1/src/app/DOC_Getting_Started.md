# Getting Started With The Platform

This guide was discovered automatically because its filename starts with
`DOC_`. The front matter controls the sidebar placement and the navigation
label.

## Steps

1. Place your source markdown anywhere under the project tree.
2. Ensure the file name begins with the configured prefix (default `DOC_`).
3. Run `doc-builder` so the file is copied into the documentation workspace.
