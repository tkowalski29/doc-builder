# Platform Tour

This page illustrates doc-builder's fallback behaviour when front matter is
present but minimal. The body is discovered automatically and included in the
generated site.

- **Dashboards** highlight system health.
- **Queues** track asynchronous jobs.
- **Releases** document recent deployments.
