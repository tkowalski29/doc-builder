# Webhook Integrations

Webhook integrations broadcast important lifecycle events to third-party
systems. Configure your listener to validate the signature header and respond
within 5 seconds to avoid retries.

## Common Use Cases

- Synchronising order status with ERP systems.
- Triggering marketing automations when a campaign changes state.
- Updating inventory counts in external warehouses.
